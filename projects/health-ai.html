<h2>AI-Driven Health Diagnosis</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Medical image classification system designed to detect brain tumors, lung cancer, and pneumonia using deep learning.
</p>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>
Medical image diagnosis is time-consuming and requires expert review. This project focused on automating disease classification to assist diagnostic workflows.
</p>

<h3>Approach & Architecture</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Used pretrained EfficientNet with transfer learning</li>
  <li>Applied OpenCV-based preprocessing and normalization</li>
  <li>Implemented data augmentation to reduce overfitting</li>
  <li>Built a full training and evaluation pipeline</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results & Impact</h3>
<ul>
  <li>High-accuracy classification across 3 disease classes</li>
  <li>Reduced overfitting by <strong>25%</strong></li>
  <li>Improved robustness on unseen medical images</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<p>TensorFlow, EfficientNet, OpenCV, CNNs, Medical Image Processing</p>
